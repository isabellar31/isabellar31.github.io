I am a computer science student. I am studying computer science at CSUF. I plan to graduate in 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 4, part 2
  
  This lab was my favorite because it was a fun and interactive game. I learned how to use if-else   statements to control the game. I also was able to learn how to use cin and cout to get input from the user and display output.

* Lab 7, part 1
  
  This lab was a great exercise to learn how to use conditional statements to make decisions based    on multiple conditions. I learned how to write compound Boolean expressions using operators like && and ||.

* Lab 6, part 1
  
  This lab was a great exercise in working with command-line arguments and being able to use          vectors to store and manipulate data. I learned how to validate the number of command-line arguments and handle errors.
